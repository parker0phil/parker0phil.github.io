- **Pull System** (causes a liquid to flow uphill, without pumps, under the pull of gravity)
- **Continuous** (pressure can't be negative at any point in the system so there is a maximum energy tradeoff between fluid pressure and gravitational potential energy)
- **Feedback** (The flow and energy change at the outlet propagates back through the fluid at the speed of sound in the fluid as the energy at any point must still be equal.)

> UX + Continuous Delivery - Flow before Utilisation

- Potential for flow comes from understanding user needs
- A clear tube comes from Continous Deliver


W Edwards Deming said (in the 1970's):

>“When people and organizations focus primarily on quality..., quality tends to increase and costs fall over time. However, when people and organizations focus primarily on costs, costs tend to rise and quality declines over time.”

Siphon believes (in 2014):

>“When people and organizations focus primarily on flow, flow tends to increase and utilisation grows over time. However, when people and organizations focus primarily on utilisation, utilisation tends to fall and flow declines over time.” - EE, 2014


DRY (rubbish!, in what context?)

RYE (repeat yourself enough)

Because Reuse in Engineering Avoids Dependence
