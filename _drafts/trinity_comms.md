title: Trinity - Communication First
---

In my professional life, over the past 5 years, I've seen the software development internals of 10-20 organisations (probably 50-100 teams). The nature of my work means that I'm rarely engaged with companies that don't have "challenges". Virtually every one is "doing agile" in one way or another and most of them have already had "agile consultancy".

My general assessment of the state of the industry is pretty depressing (and the only antidote is attending conferences, talking to amazing practitioners, and seeing the pockets of excellence and inspiration hidden away)

So many people claiming to be "doing agile" but very few being "agile". I see Fragile, Badgile and downright Tragile

I'm sick of Snake-oil consultancy, Agile FrameWorkz TM (R) and badge-buying Certification.

It's time to #startover.
