title: Starting Over
---

Over the past 5 years, in my professional life, I've seen the software development internals of 10-20 organisations (probably 50-100 teams).

The [nature of my work](http://uk.linkedin.com/in/parkerphil) means that I'm rarely engaged with companies that don't have "challenges". Virtually every one has already had "agile transformation" or "agile coaching" consultancy.

My general assessment of the state of the industry is pretty depressing (and the only antidote is attending conferences, talking to amazing practitioners, and seeing the pockets of excellence and inspiration hidden away!)

So many people claiming to be "doing agile" but very few are "being agile". I see Fragile, Badgile and downright Tragile.

I'm sick of Snake-oil consultancy, Agile FrameWorkz TM (R) and badge-buying Certification.

It's time to #startover.

#  Trinity

This is an attempt for me to document my values/beliefs/conclusions of how Software Development should operate most fruitfully.

I want to do this in a single, cohesive way (but no, I don't intend to trademark it or sell certification!).

It's non-prescriptive, and as with all good documentation, it's just a placeholder for a conversation.

So here goes...

### 1) Communication First

I've never seen a project fail for communicating too much (at least not when being mindful of the quality of the communication)

Types of Communication


Using code to communicate to your future self (or that Axe Wielding Maniac you should always think will pick up your code next...)
Meeting Management

### 2) Principles > Practices / Processes

Principles, Practices and Processes are to engender Culture.
A cohesive culture removes boiler-plate communication therefore allowing time spent communicating to be more targeted at revenue-generating ideas.

And obviously both > Tools.

### 3) Measured Effectiveness


Feedback

Productivity - If you measure storypoints of a scrum team, you'll end up with a scrum team that delivers nothing but storypoints.


#  What Next?

Over the coming weeks I'll publish a series of more detailed blog posts for each of the three areas above.

#### P.S. "Trinity"? WTF?
I do realise that the name I'm giving this is rather grandiose for the random musings everybody needs a #hashtag and we all know that all good things come in threes...
