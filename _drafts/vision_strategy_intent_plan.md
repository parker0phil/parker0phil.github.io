title: Vision, Strategy, Intent, Plan (VSIP)
---

VSIP ("vee-sip") is an informal method for communicating forward-looking activities.

Can be used at different levels programme/domain/org

_**Vision**_
sets the guiding objectives.
It should be aspirational and is independent of individuals, technologies and time scales.
Vision only changes with dramatic shifts in the business and would likely justify abandonment of the initiative.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _**Strategy**_
is the method(s) that we propose using to achieve the vision, based on current knowledge.
It takes into account the current position, and makes broad decisions regarding teams and technologies.
Strategy may change (pivot) but should always be guided by the vision. It is independent of time scales.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _**Intent**_
is the agreement of the next steps that should be made to achieve the Strategy.
Intent should specify broad objectives in relation to time scales (scope of months or years), technologies, components and teams.
However, it is liable to change, as new information becomes available, even if the strategy stays constant.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _**Plan**_
is the specific details of how, when, and by whom, iterations of change (both now and next) will be delivered.
Plan should be used for planning of dependencies (e.g. other product releases, above-the-line campaigns) but should ideally be kept out of political/high-level stakeholder discussions (try to talk in terms of Intent/Strategy instead).
